	depends on SPI
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a GSC security microcontroller from Google LLC
	  It will be accessible using a TPM-style transport interface from within
	  Linux.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called gsc-spi.

config GOOGLE_LOGBUFFER
	tristate "Google logbuffer"
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the logbuffer driver from Google LLC. The driver

	tristate "Driver to allow access for decrypting encrypted ramoops"
	depends on PSTORE_CONSOLE
	help
	  Say 'Y' here to enable access to ramoops encryption metadata. The
	  encryption metablock contains ramoops encryption parameters.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
